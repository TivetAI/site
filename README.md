## Intro

### Features

- üîã **Batteries Included**: State, RPC, events, & scheduling included out of the box.
- üíæ **Persistent & In-Memory**: Supports storing actor state in-memory that's automatically persisted for high-performance workloads.
- ‚ö° **Multiplayer & Realtime**: Build realtime or multiplayer applications on top of actors. :floppy_disk:
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Serverless & Scalable**: Built on your serverless runtime of choice to make deploying, scaling, and cost management easy.

### Supported Platform

- [**Tivet**](https://actorcore.org/platforms/tivet) - Managed Tivet platform

### Use Cases

Tivet is ideal for applications that need coordinated state across multiple clients. Some common use cases include:

- AI agents
- Game Servers
- Collaborative applications
- Local-first apps
- Discord Activities
- Chat Apps
- Yjs Sync & Storage
- Sandboxed Code Execution

By handling the complexities of state management and coordination, ActorCore lets you focus on building your application logic rather than wrestling with distributed systems primitives.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Installation

```bash npm
# npm
npm add tivet

# pnpm
pnpm add tivet

# Yarn
yarn add tivet

# Bun
bun add tivet
```

### Step 2: Create an Actor

```typescript
import { Actor, type Rpc } from "tivet";

export interface State {
    messages: { username: string; message: string }[];
}

export default class ChatRoom extends Actor<State> {
    // initialize this._state
    _onInitialize() {
        return { messages: [] };
    }

    // receive an remote procedure call from the client
    sendMessage(rpc: Rpc<ChatRoom>, username: string, message: string) {
        // save message to persistent storage
        this._state.messages.push({ username, message });

        // broadcast message to all clients
        this._broadcast("newMessage", username, message);
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Connect to Actor

```typescript
import { Client } from "tivet/client";
import type ChatRoom from "../src/chat-room.ts";

const client = new Client(/* manager endpoint */);

// connect to chat room
const chatRoom = await client.get<ChatRoom>({ name: "chat" });

// listen for new messages
chatRoom.on("newMessage", (username: string, message: string) =>
    console.log(`Message from ${username}: ${message}`),
);

// send message to room
await chatRoom.sendMessage("william", "All the world's a stage.");
```
